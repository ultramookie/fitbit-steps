fitbit steps

simple script to export fitbit step counts into individual json files.
i am using it to generate data to ingest into splunk.

in order for all this to work....

go to http://dev.fitbit.com and register an account, then register an app. from there you will get your client key and client secret.

get: https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit

then use the gather_keys_cli.py to get your oauth_token and oauth_token_secret.

take my script and add it to the root of python-fitbit so that you can use the python-fitbit wrapper.

add all four of the things from above into my script. also, grab your user id and add to script.

run and be happy.
